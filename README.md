## How to use

### Building stage

Add a new workflow by creating a `.yml` file under `.github/workflows` with this content

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
name: CI
jobs:
  flatpak:
    name: "Flatpak"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: bilelmoussaoui/flatpak-github-actions:gnome-40
      options: --privileged
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: bilelmoussaoui/flatpak-github-actions/flatpak-builder@v4
      with:
        bundle: palette.flatpak
        manifest-path: org.gnome.zbrown.Palette.yml
        cache-key: flatpak-builder-${{ github.sha }}
```

#### Inputs

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| ---     | ----------- | ----------- |----|
| `manifest-path` | The relative path of the manifest file  | Required | - |
| `bundle` | The bundle name  | Optional | `app.flatpak` |
| `repository-name` | The repository name, used to fetch the runtime when the user download the Flatpak bundle or when building the application  | Optional | `flathub` |
| `repository-url` | The repository url, used to fetch the runtime when the user download the Flatpak bundle or when building the application  | Optional | `https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo` |
| `run-tests` | Enable/Disable running tests. This overrides the `flatpak-builder` option of the same name, which invokes `make check` or `ninja test`. Network and X11 access is enabled, with a display server provided by `xvfb-run`.  | Optional | `false` |
| `branch` | The default flatpak branch  | Optional | `master` |
| `cache` | Enable/Disable caching `.flatpak-builder` directory | Optional | `true` |
| `cache-key` | Specifies the cache key. CPU arch is automatically added, so there is no need to add it to the cache key. | Optional | `flatpak-builder-${sha256(manifestPath)}` |
| `arch` | Specifies the CPU architecture to build for | Optional | `x86_64` |
| `mirror-screenshots-url` | Specifies the URL to mirror screenshots | Optional | - |

#### Building for multiple CPU architectures

To build for CPU architectures other than `x86_64`, the GitHub Actions workflow has to either natively be running on that architecture (e.g. on an `aarch64` self-hosted GitHub Actions runner), or the container used must be configured to emulate the requested architecture (e.g. with QEMU).

For example, to build a Flatpak for both `x86_64` and `aarch64` using emulation, use the following workflow as a guide:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
name: CI
jobs:
  flatpak:
    name: "Flatpak"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: bilelmoussaoui/flatpak-github-actions:gnome-40
      options: --privileged
    strategy:
      matrix:
        arch: [x86_64, aarch64]
      # Don't fail the whole workflow if one architecture fails
      fail-fast: false
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    # Docker is required by the docker/setup-qemu-action which enables emulation
    - name: Install deps
      run: |
        dnf -y install docker
    - name: Set up QEMU
      id: qemu
      uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v1
      with:
        platforms: arm64
    - uses: bilelmoussaoui/flatpak-github-actions/flatpak-builder@v4
      with:
        bundle: palette.flatpak
        manifest-path: org.gnome.zbrown.Palette.yml
        cache-key: flatpak-builder-${{ github.sha }}
        arch: ${{ matrix.arch }}
```

### Deployment stage

If you want to deploy the successfully built Flatpak application to a remote repository

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
name: Deploy
jobs:
  flatpak:
    name: "Flatpak"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: bilelmoussaoui/flatpak-github-actions:gnome-40
      options: --privileged
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: bilelmoussaoui/flatpak-github-actions/flatpak-builder@v4
      name: "Build"
      with:
        bundle: palette.flatpak
        manifest-path: org.gnome.zbrown.Palette.yml
        cache-key: flatpak-builder-${{ github.sha }}
    - uses: bilelmoussaoui/flatpak-github-actions/flat-manager@v3
      name: "Deploy"
      with:
        repository: elementary
        flat-manager-url: https://flatpak-api.elementary.io
        token: some_very_hidden_token
        end-of-life: "The application has been renamed to..."
        end-of-life-rebase: "org.zbrown.Palette"
```

#### Inputs

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| ---     | ----------- | ----------- |----|
| `repository` | The repository to push the build into  | Required | - |
| `flat-manager-url` | The flat-manager remote URL  | Required | - |
| `token` | A flat-manager token  | Required | - |
| `end-of-life` | Reason for end of life  | Optional | - |
| `end-of-life-rebase` | The new app-id  | Optional | - |

### Docker Image

The Docker image used for the action consists of 2 parts: The base image, based on Fedora and which can be found
[here](./Dockerfile), and the specific image of the runtime you choose, which is generated through
[this](.github/workflows/docker.yml) GitHub Actions workflow.

You can specify the specific runtime you need to use through the image tags:

| Runtime         | Version | Tag                 | Example                                                          |
